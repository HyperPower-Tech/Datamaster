function [ outputs ] = analysisSample(ds, otherInputs)
    %This is a sample function to demonstrate how to write a function to
    %analyize data using Datamaster
    %Input
    %ds: At a bare minimum the first input must be a array of datasource
    %otherInputs: Any number of additional inputs can be used by the
    %function
    %
    %Outputs: No requirements exist for the output of the function
    
    %Now do any preallocation that needs to occur for example
